Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game that originated in the 1960s and gained immense popularity when it was included in the Microsoft Windows operating system starting from Windows 3.1. The game is played on a grid of squares, where some squares contain hidden mines. The objective is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines without triggering a mine.
